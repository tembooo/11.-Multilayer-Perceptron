1. The number of neurons at the input layer corresponds with the dimensionality of the feature space:
Answer: True
In a neural network, each input neuron receives one feature from the input data. Therefore, if your input data has two features, the input layer will have two neurons. This matches the dimensionality of the feature space.

2. The sensitivity at a hidden unit is proportional to the weighted sum of the sensitivities at the next layer:
Answer: True
This statement refers to the backpropagation algorithm. During training, the error is propagated backward from the output layer to the input. For a hidden neuron, its sensitivity (error signal) is calculated as the weighted sum of the sensitivities in the next layer. This allows the network to update the weights even in layers that donâ€™t directly output a prediction.

3. In the feed-forward operation, the loss is fed forward in the layered architecture so that the error can be computed at the output layer:
Answer: False
In feed-forward neural networks, data flows from input to output through the network layers. The loss is not "fed forward." Instead, the loss is computed only at the output layer by comparing the predicted output with the ground truth. Then, during backpropagation, the gradient of the loss is propagated backward to adjust the weights.

4. The number of neurons at the output layer depends on the number of classes:
Answer: True
For binary classification problems, the network typically uses a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function. For multi-class classification, the output layer usually has as many neurons as there are classes, with a softmax activation function. Therefore, the number of output neurons depends on the number of target classes.

5. Since MLPs have been shown to be universal function approximators, they can be used to solve any classification problem in a straightforward manner:
Answer: False
Although multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are universal function approximators in theory, meaning they can approximate any function given sufficient neurons and layers, this does not guarantee straightforward practical implementation. Real-world classification problems often involve challenges such as noisy data, imbalanced classes, or complex decision boundaries. Effective training may require careful network design, hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and sufficient data.
